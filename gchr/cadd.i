How it works
To start negotiating custom terms and pricing, talk to your preferred ISV or Consulting Partner. When negotiations are complete, provide your AWS Account ID(s) and the point of contact who will manage the offer. Next, your ISV or Consulting Partner will create a Seller Private Offer or Consulting Partner Private Offer including the negotiated pricing and terms. When your offer is ready, your point of contact will receive an offer URL to complete the purchase in just a few clicks.
Prepare to accept an offer
 Verify your AWS payment method and tax settings for your payer account in the Billing and Cost Management console.

Verify if your company utilizes AWS Organizations to manage multiple linked accounts and identify who will take the next step subscribing to an offer.
